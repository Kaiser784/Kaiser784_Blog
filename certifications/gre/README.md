# GRE

### Prologue

&#x20;I decided to give GRE almost 6 months back in September of 2022, gathered all the papers, books, and PDFs, and even got the magoosh 6-month premium as it was cheaper than the 2-month. At the time I read a lot of prep blogs most of them had only 1 or 2-month prep and I thought I could accomplish more in 6, turns out I was wrong, without the impending doom of a deadline my college brain didn't want to put enough effort in it. Now with almost only a month left, I decided to turn up the effort to full and log what I do every day till D-Day.

I'll be following the GregMAT 1-month GRE plan and also use the magoosh tests to consistently evaluate myself. as of writing this Prologue I've done 4 days of the 1-month plan and will be continuing from Day 5. All the resources I use will be uploaded to my GitHub repo and divided based on the ones I used and the extra material that other people might use.
