I'm **Paul Babu Kadali**, a University student currently studying Computer Engineering. I'm an Information Security enthusiast. My areas of interest include Forensics, Penetration Testing and OSINT. I'm still trying my best to get used to live CTF's. Currently, I'm working on my OSCP certification.

I'll be sharing my experience and research related to Information Security here.
