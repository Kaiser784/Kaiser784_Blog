# Conclusion

I started this challenge without much of knowledge on much of the topics I covered including Bug Bounty which I didn't intend much on working too much on as I'm not heavily interested in it. Combined with my procrastination and indecisiveness in choosing a BB program, I couldn't fully start in even one of them. I now have a private invite and decided to plan things properly and stick to it no matter what.

At the start of this challenge I didn't plan much of anything to do every day even the tools I used to log, organize and take notes were all just one which was Obsidian. Not to say that it was bad but I realized very late that you should not depend too much in one tool so by the end of this challenge I was using Notion and Obsidian in tandem to properly organize and work things out. By the time I'm writing this it's been 2 weeks since I adopted this tandem and it's been working pretty fine and I was better organized than before.

I know it's not much that I did in these 90 days but I did come out of them with better knowledge, clearer understanding of what I wanna do in security and a Research Internship. I didn't only improve technically but also as a person, learnt how to pick myself up, how to organize myself and most definetly how to set achievable goals. I don't know if I would recommend everyone to do this but I did learn a lot, So maybe you should try it at least halfway.&#x20;

I know I initially said this would be a 120 day challenge and I do feel sad for cutting it short to 90 days but I realized it would be better for me to take proper breaks and focus on the stuff more deeply without the burden of trying to do it everyday. I might do this challenge again after I gain more knowledge and experience so do check it out then.
