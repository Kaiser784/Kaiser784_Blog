# Log-2

### Summary

The first 2 weeks were dedicated to solving the Dante lab and completed it but now had some dilemma with what to do next and then decided to practice the rest of free HTB challenges and machines in a kind of preparation for Synack Technical Assessment and send the mail/application in mid-November.

As for the Bug-Bounty I was mostly just reading writeups and other books related to BB. I tried to setup frameworks and tools to organize work and scope and getting checklists ready in obsidian(still incomplete have to work it out into next month). I know I'm procrastinating but I would like things to be more sorted and organized than just randomly finding bugs on a site and forgetting about it.

Read upon 2 more Research papers and watched talks and presentations related to them. Got an opportunity to work as a Research Intern which will start from December, will try to do some groundwork on it before starting, Will keep posted or make blogs related to it unless it's not allowed.

### Takeaways

* [ ] Get organized and start BB in full commitment
* [ ] Try to look into more research during the opportunity
* [ ] Try to be on your toes by participating in atleast 1 CTF per week

### Catenate
