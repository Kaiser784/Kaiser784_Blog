# Log-3

Due to University I decided to take a month break until I complete my finals and then resume everything in full force.

Participated in a CTF during a weekend but that was all I did in November.

### Summary

I've been working on Malware Analysis for the most part of December as part of the Research Intern, reading up on papers and different tools and methodologies, etc. Got a private program invitation on intigriti after applying without having any reported bugs, last week of December, didn't find any bugs, still exploring the Web-App.

Participated in a couple of Year-End CTF's, but for the most part of the last week it was leisure and not too much pressure as it was the holidays

### Takeaways

* [ ] Got an understanding of how to properly work on BB program rather than just finding only certain types of bugs
* [ ] Getting more into Malware Research kind of on the hardware side
* [ ] Working more on CTF's with duos or teams is fun&#x20;

### Catenate
