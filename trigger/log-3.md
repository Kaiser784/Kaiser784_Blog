### Lancement

Due to the semester being online for my university caused miscommunication and mismanagement in the admin, I had to give an exam almost every other day for the last 3 weeks of November and was swamped with assignments. Tried my best to keep the streak but was too much for me, So decided to take a month break until I complete my finals and then resume everything in full force.

Participated in a CTF during a weekend but that was all I could do in November properly.

### Summary

I've been working on Malware Analysis for the most part of December as part of the Research Intern, reading up on papers and different tools and methodologies, etc. Got a private program invitation on intigriti after applying without having any reported bugs, last week of December, didn't find any bugs, still exploring the Web-App.

Participated in a couple of Year-End CTF's, but for the most part of the last week it was leisure and not too much pressure as it was the holidays

### Takeaways

* [ ] Got an understanding of how to properly work on BB program rather than just finding only certain types of bugs
* [ ] Getting more into Malware Research kind of on the hardware side
* [ ] Working more on CTF's with duos or teams is fun&#x20;
