### Lancement

Due to the semester being online for my university caused miscommunication and mismanagement in the admin, I had to give an exam almost every other day for the last 3 weeks of November and was swamped with assignments. Tried my best to keep the streak but was too much for me, So decided to take a month break until I complete my finals and then resume everything in full force.

Participated in a CTF during a weekend but that was all I could do in November properly.

Will update on Jan 1, 2021.
