### Summary

Due to University I decided to take a month break until I complete my finals and then resume everything in full force.

I've been working on Malware Analysis for the most part of December as part of the Research Intern, reading up on papers and different tools and methodologies, etc. Can't give out too much of the work as it's still not published.

Still no reply back from Synack but got a private program invitation on intigriti after applying without having any reported bugs in last week of December. The Program had a good scope and also generous bounty and also not too many out-of-scope bug types. I didn't find any bugs, still exploring the Web-App. I think I'll end up sticking to this program for atleast 2 months before even looking at another program.

Participated in a couple of Year-End CTF's and started making notes instead of writeups on Obsidian which are tailored for me, but for the most part of the last week it was leisure and not too much pressure as it was the holidays. Used that time to organize stuff between Notion and Obsidian

### Takeaways

* [ ] Got an understanding of how to properly work on BB program rather than just finding only certain types of bugs&#x20;
* [ ] Getting more into Malware Research kind of on the hardware side&#x20;
* [ ] Working more on CTF's with duos or teams is fun
