# Ingress

Everyone asks for Prerequisites when starting in security, so let's get to it first.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're reading this and don't understand a term or an acronym try your best to google it, coz there **will** be a lot of googling when you get into security.
{% endhint %}

### Do I need to know programming/coding?

No matter how much you avoid it you'll end up writing scripts, it may either be modifying existing scripting tools or making your own. But as you are just starting out you won't be doing it that much at the beginning.

But the ability to read code will be very helpful at the start, you should also be able to adapt to different programming languages. The major ones I would recommend you to look over would be `Python, Ruby, Bash, C/C+` , in no way I mean to become an expert in these languages before you start but have a basic understanding of how they work. The amount of code you'll be looking at for exploits and vulnerabilities while pentesting, you'll pretty much learn it from there.

### Do I need to use Kali Linux? Can I use Windows?

To be frank, any Linux Distro will do the job, Kali gets all the tools required for pentesting pre-installed which makes it a bit easier. 

You can use windows for pentesting, but its hard to use some tools so I would recommend to either use WSL\(Windows Subsystem for Linux\) or a VM\(Virtual machine\). If you're feeling adventurous you can dual-boot your system but I highly recommend not to do it without someone to help you with it.

As for me, I use Kali Linux as my main machine which is a pretty dumb move from my side but I invested too much time in it now to switch.

### **Do I need to learn Computer Networking?**

You need to know the basics of it and most terms in it. You can try learn it from different books or try to learn it from pentesting writeups.

For books I would recommend Comptia Network+ but it gets a bit boring without any practical application, so I would recommend to learn it through pentesting.

## What I would recommend you to do 



### Now for where to actually practice

* [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

  You can learn a lot of basic to intermediate stuff here from Linux to Web Application Security

* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)

  This is the most beginner friendly site, it has a lot of resources to learn from and experiment on legally.

* [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)

  This contains archives of previous picoCTF's, you can practice them it's very helpful when trying to test your basic knowledge. They also hold yearly CTF's in Feb-Mar.

* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)

  This is not exactly a site for hacking but you can practice your scripting slkills in different languages, it also contains some cryptography challenges.

* [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu)

  This one's a pretty hardcore site, I would highly suggest beginnners to steer clear of this site until you think you're atleast an intermediate level.

* [OSPG](https://portal.offensive-security.com)

  This one is purely penetration testing and has very good and interesting machines.

When practicing in any of the above sites do not hesitate to look at solutions because you're in the learning phase, you don't know a lot of stuff in the begnning, learn from the solutions and note them down.

### How to keep-up in the security world

Twitter, Reddit and Youtube play a huge role in keeping up with everything going on currently in the community. LinkedIn is a bit stagnant but its pretty helpful in following what are security companies doing.

Here are some profiles you can follow to start off you can find other good ones through their retweets and mentions.
