# Logs

### Day - 1

**Duration - 40 min**

**Summary**

Read "First Bug-Bounty" Writeups to get different perspectives on how people tackled at initial points, dealt with dupes and rejections.

Started practicing Golang on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). I used CodeWars because I think it's the only website that matched my vibe of not being Competitive Programming but at the same time exponentially increasing my understanding of a language with each kata. I learned python the same way from here a year back.

### Day - 2

**Duration - 25 min**

**Summary**

Only read some writeups about API and Recon couldn't do more due to academic deadlines. Will try to wrap up academic stuff faster so they don't pile up and take away time from me.

Also decided to take the Dante Pro Lab from HTB which upon completing can be used to bypass synack waitlist, will start working on it from tomorrow.

### Day - 3

**Duration - 2 hrs**

**Summary**

Did Initial Recon on Dante and found 2 flags. Learned different approaches in Recon and credential brute-forcing.

* Can't disclose more because of HTB policy of not disclosing writeups of Active machines.

Read some recommended writeups on medium.

### Day - 4

**Duration - 1hr 45 min**

**Summary**

Further solved the Dante Labs learned more about pivoting and different ways we can do it using different tools. Learned about `sshuttle` and `chisel` had to cycle through other methods to check which one is allowing me to scan the network without a hitch.

Did a bit of Wreath Network till the pivoting part to get some basic understanding of this concept. Planning to do Wreath parallelly with Dante.

Chose a program with a large scope on HackerOne, gonna start recon and start understanding the working of the application and read the previously disclosed reports.

### Day - 5

**Duration - 3hr 25 min**

**Summary**

Properly pivoted to the first internal network in Dante spent some time fine-tuning my approach and scans. Did recon on a bunch of IP's I found on the network, Organized it, and got an initial foothold on one of them.

Tried to get used to nuclei by performing basic scans.
