description: Why I decided to do this

# Trigger

I have been slacking off lately with Pentesting and CTF's and also been procrastinating with starting Bug Bounties which I think is mainly because I can't prioritize stuff between my academics and this.

So to kind of challenge myself and feel the adrenaline rush again which brought me into the Cybersecurity community and world, I decided to do the [ **High frequency security bug hunting: 120 days, 120 bugs**](https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/) by shubs.io .

As I'm not even a Beginner Bug hunter I decided to do a mix of bug hunting, learning different stuff related to hunting and also some HTB related to Synack.

So my version won't be 120 days, 120 bugs but "**High Frequency Security Training: 120 days level-up**". I'll try my best to find bugs in this length but it won't be the highest priority.

I'll be logging my Daily activity/logs on Obsidian locally and update it here weekly. For the References section only some of the references I started out with that day are included, I didn't put all the rabbit hole articles or other ones. I'll upload my knowledge base at end of 120 days. I had to roll back on time some days because of Uni load hope that doesn't demotivate me or any of the people wanting to attempt this.
