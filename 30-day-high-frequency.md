# 30 Day High Frequency

It's been almost 3 years since I did this last time, which was not very successful in execution. Right now I just gave my final exam of my final year at university and have a considerable amount of free time for a while during which I think I should go monk mode. So I'm thinking instead of calling it 90 days from the start and overwhelming myself I'll do a 30 days cracked one and then extend it.

Describing my current situation right now, I haven't done Bug Bounty since the last high frequency at all, working on a paper with a Security Research Institute. Been a while since I participated in CTFs , have some ideas for tools and side-projects(startup in stealth). I don't want this stint to only be focused on Security as that's very limiting and would cause a faster burnout, so I'll try to keep this as diverse as possible.

So I'll be trying to do at least 2 of the below mentioned things once a day&#x20;

* [ ] Bug Bounty
* [ ] Research Paper
* [ ] CTF / Security Upskill
* [ ] Tools (public on my [github](https://github.com/Kaiser784?tab=repositories)) / Side project&#x20;
